<h1>ConditionOne</h1>
<h2>The DEFCON Scheduling Tool</h2>
<br>
If you're interested in InfoSec, lockpicking, or blue mohawks, you know that Mickey Mouse was wrong - the happiest place on Earth isn't Disney, it's DEFCON. Any DEFCON attendee is certainly familiar with the "kid-in-the-candy-store" feeling that comes from looking at the conference schedule and trying to decide what talks they want to see. Well, ConditionOne won't make that decision any easier, but it'll help make sure you know when and where you need to be to see whatever it is you want to see. 
<br>
<br>
ConditionOne scrapes talk information from the DEFCON web page and presents it in a clean and concise manner to the user. In the current version of the project, the user must download the DEFCON talks schedule web page and pass the html file to ConditionOne when it is run from a terminal.

ConditionOne is currently in a pre-alpha state, so don't rely on it for anything yet. You can find some more information in the built in "help" function. This readme will be updated once the program is in a state worth calling a beta. In the meantime, if you want to try out ConditionOne, download this repo, navigate to the directory, and run <code>python main.py $PATH/TO/DEFCON_WEBSITE.html</code>
