<h3 class="talkTitle">Untrustworthy Hardware and How to Fix It</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 10:00 in Track 4</p>
	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
<h4 class="speaker">0ctane<span class="speakerTitle"> Hacker</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Modern computing platforms offer more freedom than 
ever before. The rise of Free and Open Source Software has led to more 
secure and heavily scrutinized cryptographic solutions. However, below 
the surface of open source operating systems, strictly closed source 
firmware along with device driver blobs and closed system architecture 
prevent users from examining, understanding, and trusting the systems 
where they run their private computations. Embedded technologies like 
Intel Management Engine pose significant threats when, not if, they get 
exploited.  Advanced attackers in possession of firmware signing keys, 
and even potential access to chip fabrication, could wreak untold havoc 
on cryptographic devices we rely on.<br><br>

After surveying all-too-possible low level attacks on critical systems, 
we will introduce an alternative open source solution to peace-of-mind 
cryptography and private computing.  By using programmable logic chips, 
called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, this device is more open source 
than any common personal computing system to date. No blobs, no hidden 
firmware features, and no secret closed source processors.  This concept
 isn't "unhacakable", rather we believe it to be the most fixable; this 
is what users and hackers should ultimately be fighting for.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>0ctane</strong><br> 0ctane is a longtime 
hobbyist hacker, with experience primarily in UNIX systems and hardware.
  Holding no official training or technical employment, 0ctane spends 
most of their free time building and restoring older computer systems, 
hanging out at surplus stores and tracking down X86 alternatives with an
 occasional dabbling in OSX and 802.11 exploitation.  Other interests 
include SDR and RF exploration, networking, cryptography, computer 
history, distributed computing...really anything that sounds cool that I
 happen to stumble on at 3am.  </p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Evading next-gen AV using artificial intelligence</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Saturday at 11:00 in Track 4</p>
	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Hyrum Anderson<span class="speakerTitle"> Technical Director of Data Science, Endgame</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Much of next-gen AV relies on machine learning to 
generalize to never-before-seen malware. Less well appreciated, however,
 is that machine learning can be susceptible to attack by, ironically, 
other machine learning models.  In this talk, we demonstrate an AI agent
 trained through reinforcement learning to modify malware to evade 
machine learning malware detection.  Reinforcement learning has produced
 game-changing AI's that top human level performance in the game of Go 
and a myriad of hacked retro Atari games (e.g., Pong).  In an analogous 
fashion, we demonstrate an AI agent that has learned through thousands 
of "games" against a next-gen AV malware detector which sequence of 
functionality-preserving changes to perform on a Windows PE malware file
 so that it bypasses the detector.  No math or machine learning 
background is required; fundamental understanding of malware and Windows
 PE files is a welcome; and previous experience hacking Atari Pong is a 
plus.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Hyrum Anderson</strong><br> Hyrum Anderson
 is technical director of data scientist at Endgame, where he leads 
research on detecting adversaries and their tools using machine 
learning.   Prior to joining Endgame he conducted information security 
and situational awareness research as a researcher at FireEye, Mandiant,
 Sandia National Laboratories and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.  He received 
his PhD in Electrical Engineering (signal and image processing + machine
 learning) from the University of Washington and BS/MS degrees from 
Brigham Young University.  Research interests include adversarial 
machine learning, deep learning, large-scale malware classification, 
active learning, and early time-series classification.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Dealing the perfect hand - Shuffling memory blocks on z/OS</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Saturday at 16:00 in 101 Track</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Ayoul3<span class="speakerTitle"> Pentester, Wavestone</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Follow me on a journey where we p0wn one of the most
 secure platforms on earth. A giant mammoth that still powers the most 
critical business functions around the world: The Mainframe! Be it a 
wire transfer, an ATM withdrawal, or a flight booking, you can be sure 
that you've used the trusted services of a Mainframe at least once 
during the last 24 hours. In this talk, I will present methods of 
privilege escalation on IBM z/OS: How to leverage a simple access to 
achieve total control over the machine and impersonate other users. If 
you are interested in mainframes or merely curious to see a what a shell
 looks like on MVS, you're welcome to tag along.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Ayoul3</strong><br> Ayoub is a pentester 
working for Wavestone, a consulting firm based in France. He got 
interested in Mainframe security in 2014 when, during an audit, he 
noticed the big security gap between this platform and standard systems 
like Windows and Unix. A gap that makes little sense since z/OS has been
 around for a while and is used by most major companies to perform 
critical business operations: wire transfer, claim refunds, bookings,

<h4 class="speaker">Dor Azouri<span class="speakerTitle"> Security researcher, @SafeBreach</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Windows' BITS service is a middleman for your 
download jobs. You start a BITS job, and from that point on, BITS is 
responsible for the download. But what if we tell you that BITS is a 
careless middleman? We have uncovered the way BITS maintains its jobs 
queue using a state file on disk, and found a way for a local 
administrator to control jobs using special modifications to that file<br><br>

Comprehending this file's binary structure allowed us to change a job's 
properties (such as RemoteURL, Destination Path...) in runtime and even 
inject our own custom job, using none of BITS' public interfaces. This 
method, combined with the generous notification feature of BITS, allowed
 us to run a program of our will as the LocalSystem account, within 
session 0. So if you wish to execute your code as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM 
and the first options that come to mind are psexec/creating a service, 
we now add a new option: BITSInject.<br><br>

Here, we will not only introduce the practical method we formed, but 
also: Reveal the binary structure of the state file for you to play 
with, and some knowledge we gathered while researching the service flow<br><br>

We will also provide free giveaways: A one-click python tool that 
performs the described method; SimpleBITSServer - a pythonic BITS 
server; A struct definition file, to use for parsing your BITS state 
file</p>

<p class="abstract">To understand the Android ecosystem today, one must 
understand Android packers. Whether used for protecting legitimate apps'
 business logic or hiding malicious content, Android packer usage is on 
the rise. Android packers continue to increase their efforts to prevent 
reverse engineers and static analysis engines from understanding what's 
inside the package. To do so they employ elaborate tactics, including 
state of the art ELF tampering, obfuscation and various anti-debugging 
techniques.<br><br>

In this talk, we will provide an overview of the packer industry and 
present real world test cases. We will do a deep technical dive into the
 internal workings of popular Android packers, exposing the different

<h4 class="speaker">Ryan Baxendale <span class="speakerTitle"> </span></h4>
<p class="abstract">There are more cloud service providers offering 
serverless or Function-as-a-service platforms for quickly deploying and 
scaling applications without the need for dedicated server instances and
 the overhead of system administration. This technical talk will cover 
the basic concepts of microservices and FaaS, and how to use them to 
scale time consuming offensive security testing tasks. Attacks that were
 previously considered impractical due to time and resource constraints 
can now be considered feasible with the availability of cloud services 
and the never-ending free flow of public IP addresses to avoid 
attribution and blacklists.<br><br>

Key takeaways include a guide to scaling your tools and a demonstration 
on the practical benefits of utilising cloud services in performing 
undetected port scans, opportunistic attacks against short lived network
 services, brute-force attacks on services and OTP values, and creating 
your own whois database, shodan/censys, and searching for the elusive 
internet accessible IPv6 hosts.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Max Bazaliy <span class="speakerTitle"> Security Researcher, Lookout</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">On April 24, 2015, Apple launched themselves into 
the wearables category with the introduction of Apple Watch. This June, 
at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple announced that their 
watch is not only the #1 selling smartwatch worldwide by far, but also 
announced the introduction of new capabilities that will come with the 
release of watchOS 4. Like other devices, Apple Watch contains highly 
sensitive user data such as email and text messages, contacts, GPS and 
more, and like other devices and operating systems, has become a target 
for malicious activity.<br><br>

This talk will provide an overview of Apple Watch and watchOS security 
mechanisms including codesign enforcement, sandboxing, memory 
protections and more. We will cover vulnerabilities and exploitation 
details and dive into the techniques used in creating an Apple Watch 
jailbreak. This will ultimately lead to a demonstration and explanation 
of jailbreaking an Apple Watch, showcasing how it can access important 
user data and applications.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Starting the Avalanche: Application DoS In Microservice Architectures</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Friday at 13:00 in Track 3</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Scott Behrens<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Application Security Engineer</span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Jeremy Heffner<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Cloud Security Engineer</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">We'd like to introduce you to one of the most 
devastating ways to cause service instability in modern micro-service 
architectures: application DDoS.  Unlike traditional network DDoS that 
focuses on network pipes and edge resources, our talk focuses on 
identifying and targeting expensive calls within a micro-services 
architecture, using their complex interconnected relationships to cause 
the system to attack itself â with massive effect.  In modern 
microservice architectures it's easier to cause service instability with
 sophisticated requests that model legitimate traffic to pass right 
through web application firewalls. <br><br>

We will discuss how the Netflix application security team identified 
areas of our microservices that laid the groundwork for these 
exponential-work attacks.  We'll step through one case study of how a 
single request into an API endpoint fans out through the application 
fabric and results in an exponential set of dependent service calls.  
Disrupting even one point within the dependency graph can have a 
cascading effect throughout not only the initial endpoint, but the 
dependent services backing other related API services.<br><br>

We will then discuss the frameworks we collaborated on building that 
refine the automation and reproducibility of testing the endpoints, 
which we've already successfully leveraged against our live production 
environment. We will provide a demonstration of the frameworks which 
will be open sourced in conjunction with this presentation. Attendees 
will leave this talk understanding architectural and technical 
approaches to identify and remediate application DDoS vulnerabilities 
within their own applications.  Attendees will also gain a greater 
understanding on how take a novel new attack methodology and build an 
orchestration framework that can be used at a global scale.</p>

<p class="abstract">The second half of 2016 saw the rise of a new 
generation of IoT botnets consisting of webcams and other IoT devices. 
These botnets were then subsequently used to launch DDoS attacks on an 
unprecedented scale against Olympic-affiliated organizations, OVH, the 
web site of Brian Krebs and Dyn.<br><br>

Early 2017, a multi-stage Windows Trojan containing code to scan for 
vulnerable IoT devices and inject them with Mirai bot code was 
discovered. The number of IoT devices which were previously safely 
hidden inside corporate perimeters, vastly exceeds those directly 
accessible from the Internet, allowing for the creation of botnets with 
unprecedented reach and scale.  <br><br>

This reveals an evolution in the threat landscape that most 
organizations are completely unprepared to deal with and will require a 
fundamental shift in how we defend against DDoS attacks.<br><br>

This presentation will include:<br>- An analysis of the Windows Mirai seeder including its design, history, infection vectors and potential evolution.<br>- The DDoS capabilities of typically infected IoT devices including malicious traffic analysis.<br>-
 The consequences of infected IoT devices inside the corporate network 
including the impact of DDoS attacks, originating from the inside, 
targeting corporate assets and external resources.<br>- How to detect, classify and mitigate this new threat.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Hanno BÃ¶ck<span class="speakerTitle"> Hacker and freelance journalist</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">The Certificate Transparency system provides public 
logs of TLS certificates. While Certificate Transparency is primarily 
used to uncover security issues in certificates, its data is also 
valuable for other use cases. The talk will present a novel way of 
exploiting common web applications like Wordpress, Joomla or Typo3 with 
the help of Certificate Transparency.<br><br>

Certificate Transparency has helped uncover various incidents in the 
past where certificate authorities have violated rules. It is probably 
one of the most important security improvements that has ever happened 
in the certificate authority ecosystem. In September 2017 Google will 
make Certificate Transparency mandatory for all new certificates. So 
it's a good time to see how it could be abused by the bad guys.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Daniel Bohannon (DBO)<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Consultant, MANDIANT</span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Lee Holmes<span class="speakerTitle"> Lead Security Architect, Microsoft</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Attackers, administrators and many legitimate 
products rely on PowerShell for their core functionality. However, its 
power has made it increasingly attractive for attackers and commodity 
malware authors alike. How do you separate the good from the bad?<br><br>

A/V signatures applied to command line arguments work sometimes. 
AMSI-based (Anti-malware Scan Interface) detection performs 
significantly better. But obfuscation and evasion techniques like 
Invoke-Obfuscation can and do bypass both approaches.<br><br>

Revoke-Obfuscation is a framework that transforms evasion into a 
treacherous deceit. By applying a suite of unique statistical analysis 
techniques against PowerShell scripts and their structures, what was 
once a cloak of invisibility is now a spotlight. It works with .evtx 
files, command lines, scripts, ScriptBlock logs, Module logs, and is 
easy to extend.<br><br>

Approaches for evading these detection techniques will be discussed and demonstrated.<br><br>

Revoke-Obfuscation has been used in numerous Mandiant investigations to 
successfully identify obfuscated and non-obfuscated malicious PowerShell
 scripts and commands. It also detects all obfuscation techniques in 
Invoke-Obfuscation, including two new techniques being released with 
this presentation.<br><br>

<h4 class="speaker">David Latimer<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Analyst, Bishop Fox </span></h4>
<p class="abstract">When you learned that military and law enforcement 
agencies had trained screaming eagles to pluck drones from the sky, did 
you too find yourself asking: "I wonder if I could throw these eagles 
off my tail, maybe by deploying delicious bacon countermeasures?"  Well 
you'd be wise to question just how effective these emerging, first 
generation "drone defense" solutions really are, and which amount to 
little more than "snake oil". <br><br>

 There is no such thing as "best practices" when it comes to defending 
against "rogue drones", period.  Over the past 2 years, new defensive 
products that detect and respond to "rogue drones" have been crawling 
out of the woodwork.  The vast majority are immature, unproven solutions
 that require a proper vetting.  <br><br>

 We've taken a MythBusters-style approach to testing the effectiveness 
of a variety of drone defense solutions, pitting them against our 
DangerDrone.  Videos demonstrating the results should be almost as fun 
for you to watch as they were for us to produce.  Expect to witness epic
 aerial battles against an assortment of drone defense types, including:<br><br>
 
 â¢ trained eagles and falcons that hunt "rogue drones" <br>  
 â¢ fighter drones that hunt and shoot nets <br>  
 â¢ drones with large nets that swoop in and snatch up 'rogue drones' <br>  
 â¢ surface-to-air projectile weapons, including bazooka-like cannons that launch nets, and shotgun shells containing nets <br>  
 â¢ signal jamming and hijacking devices that attack drone command and control interfaces <br>  
 â¢ even frickin' laser beams and Patriot missiles! <br><br>

 We'll also be releasing DangerDrone v2.0, an upgraded version of our 
free Raspberry Pi-based pentesting quadcopter (basically a ~$500 
hacker's laptop, that can also fly).  We'll be giving away a fully 
functional DangerDrone v2.0 to one lucky audience member!    <br><br>

	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Elie Bursztein<span class="speakerTitle"> Anti-abuse research lead, Google</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">In February 2017, we announced the first SHA-1 
collision. This collision combined with a clever use of the PDF format 
allows attackers to forge PDF pairs that have identical SHA-1 hashes and
 yet display different content. This attack is the result of over two 
years of intense research. It took 6500 CPU years and 110 GPU years of 
computations which is still 100,000 times faster than a brute-force 
attack. <br><br>

In this talk, we recount how we found the first SHA-1 collision. We 
delve into the challenges we faced from developing a meaningful payload,
 to scaling the computation to that massive scale, to solving unexpected
 cryptanalytic challenges that occurred during this endeavor.<br><br>

We discuss the aftermath of the release including the positive changes 
it brought and its unforeseen consequences. For example it was 
discovered that SVN is vulnerable to SHA-1 collision attacks only after 
the WebKit SVN repository was brought down by the commit of a unit-test 
aimed at verifying that Webkit is immune to collision attacks.  <br><br>

Building on the Github and Gmail examples we explain how to use 
counter-cryptanalysis to mitigate the risk of a collision attacks 
against software that has yet to move away from SHA-1. Finally we look 
at the next generation of hash functions and what the future of hash 
security holds</p>

<p class="abstract">XenoScan is the next generation in tooling for 
hardcore game hackers. Building on the solid foundation from older tools
 like Cheat Engine and Tsearch, XenoScan makes many innovations which 
take memory scanning to a whole new level.<br><br>

This demo-heavy talk will skip the fluff and show the power of the tool 
in real-time. The talk will demonstrate how the tool can scan for 
partial structures, detect complex data structures such as binary trees 
or linked lists, detect class-instances living on the heap, and even 
group detected class instances by their types. Additional, these demos 
will take a look at the tool's extensibility by working not only on 
native processes, but also on Nintendo games running in emulators. 
You're not all game hackers, so the talk will also show how XenoScan can
 be useful in the day-to-day workflow of reverse engineers and hackers.<br><br>

When I'm not doing demos, I'll be drilling down to the low-level to talk
 about the nitty gritty details of what's happening, how it works, and 
why it works.<br><br>

By the end of the talk, you'll see the true power of a well-made, smart 
memory scanner. You'll be empowered to use it in your day to day 
hacking, whether that is on games, malware, or otherwise. For those of 
you that are really interested in the tool, it is completely open-source
 and all development is done on an interactive livestream, meaning you 
can participate in and learn from future development.</p>

<p class="abstract">In 2015, BBC sponsored Micro:Bit was launched and 
offered to one million students in the United Kingdom to teach them how 
to code. This device is affordable and have a lot of features and can be
 programmed in Python rather than C++ like the Arduino. When we 
discovered this initiative in 2016, we quickly thought it was possible 
to turn this tiny device into some kind of super-duper portable wireless
 attack tool, as it is based on a well-known 2.4GHz RF chip produced by 
Nordic Semiconductor.<br><br>

It took us a few months to hack into the Micro:Bit firmware and turn it 
into a powerful attack tool able to sniff keystrokes from wireless 
keyboards or to hijack and take complete control of quadcopters during 
flight. We also developed many tools allowing security researchers to 
interact with proprietary 2.4GHz protocols, such as an improved sniffer 
inspired by the mousejack tools designed by Bastille. We will release 
the source code of our firmware and related tools during the conference.<br><br>

The Micro:Bit will become a nifty platform to create portable RF attack

<h3 class="talkTitle">Ghost in the Droid: Possessing Android Applications with ParaSpectre</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 10:20 in Track 4</p>
	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
<h4 class="speaker">chaosdata<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Security Consultant, NCC Group</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Modern Android applications are large and complex, 
and can be a pain to analyze even without obfuscation - static analysis 
can only get one so far, the debugger sucks, Frida doesn't give you 
enough access to the Java environment, and editing smali or writing 
Xposed hooks can be time consuming and error prone. There has to be a 
better way!<br><br>

What if we could inject a command line REPL into an app to drive 
functionality? And what if we could also make writing function hooks 
fast and easy?<br><br>

In this talk, I will introduce ParaSpectre, a platform for dynamic 
analysis of Android applications that injects JRuby into Android 
applications. It bundles a hook configuration web API, a web application
 interface to configure and edit hooks, and a connect-back JRuby REPL to
 aid application exploration from the inside-out. It supports various 
selectors to match classes and methods, can be reconfigured on-the-fly 
without requiring a device reboot, and takes the pain out of writing 
method hooks for Android apps.<br><br>

ParaSpectre is for developers and security researchers alike. While not 
itself a debugger, it provides a level of access into a running 
application that a debugger generally won't.</p>

<p class="abstract">You are performing a pentest. You just owned the 
first domain controller. That was easy. All the computers are belong to 
you. But unfortunately, you can't reach the final goal. The last target 
is further in the network, non accessible and heavily filtered. 
Thankfully, one last hope remains. You realize the target domain pulls 
its updates from the WSUS server of the compromised domain, the one you 
fully control. Hope is back... But once again, it fails. The only tools 
available for controlling the updates are not working: they require a 
network attack that is prevented by the network architecture and the 
server configuration. All hope is lost...<br><br>

We will present you a new approach, allowing you to circumvent these 
limitations and to exploit this situation in order to deliver updates. 
Thus, you will be able to control the targeted network from the very 
WSUS server you own. By extension, this approach may serve as a basis 
for an air gap attack for disconnected networks.<br><br>

Our talk will describe vulnerable architectures to this approach and 
also make some in-context demonstration of the attack with new public 
tooling. Finally, as nothing is inescapable, we will also explain how 
you can protect your update architecture.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Chris Quartier<span class="speakerTitle"> Embedded Engineer, Cryptotronix, LLC</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">The security of your bitcoins rests entirely in the 
security of your private key. Bitcoin hardware wallets help protect 
against software-based attacks to recover or misuse your key. However, 
hardware attacks on these wallets are not as well studied. In 2015, 
Jochen Hoenicke was able to extract the private key from a TREZOR using a
 simple power analysis technique. While that vulnerability was patched, 
he suggested the Microcontroller on the TREZOR, which is also the same 
on the KeepKey, may be vulnerable to additional side channel attacks.<br><br>

In this presentation we will quickly overview fault injection 
techniques, timing, and power analysis methods using the Open Source 
Hardware tool, the ChipWhisperer. We then show how to apply these 
techniques to the STM32F205 which is the MCU on the Trezor and KeepKey. 
Lastly, we will present our findings of a timing attack vulnerability 
and conclude with software and hardware recommendations to improve 
bitcoin hardware wallets.  We will show and share our tools and methods 
to help you get started in breaking your own wallet!</p>

<p class="abstract">The DEF CON  panel is the place to go to learn about
 the many facets of DEF CON  and to begin your DEF CONian Adventure.  
Here you will begin your adventure that will include more than just 
listening in the talk tracks. You can get hands-on experience in the 
Villages and witness amazing feats of programming in Demo Labs.  You may
 even display your own powers by participating in a contest or two in 
the Events and Contest Area. The panel will give you what you need to 
know to navigate DEF CON  to your best advantage.  We have speakers who 
will regale you with tales of how they came to be at DEF CON  and 
(hopefully) inspire you with their personal experiences.  Oh yeah, there
 is the time honored "Name the Noob", with lots of laughs and even some 
prizes.</p>

place to feel welcomed and further their own pursuit of knowledge. 
HighWiz is the fabled Man on the Mountain whom people seek to gain a 
taste of his forbidden knowledge.  He is a rare sighting at DEF CON  
only to be glimpsed by those lucky few.</p>

growing up, she was told she could be anything so she decided to be a 
unicorn.  Ever since, she has made it her mission to ensure the truth is
 out there.  Do not attempt to use malware pickup lines on her as she 
will pull them apart and you risk having your face impaled. Though she

entertaining Worldwide Wardrive talk.  He is also the Grand Vizier of 
All Things Vendor - you are welcome.</p>
<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Wiseacre</strong><br> Wiseacre was 
introduced to DEF CON  by Roamer.  Though he appeared at his first DEF 
CON  because of the Capture the Flag contest, Roamer and HighWiz showed 
him how to make DEF CON  so much more than simply attending the talks.  
From then on he made a point to participate in as much as he could.  Of 
course, this was all within the limits of social anxiety so, if it 
allowed participation as a wallflower, he was in! Now, he wants to make 
sure everyone else gets to know as much as possible about this year's

anyone listens to him at all. Mike would like to thank Highwiz for 
everything.</p>

Arthur. He has a few philosophies on life: He believes that while the 
righteous keep moving forward, those with clean hands become stronger 
and stronger . That the field of battle between God and Satan is the 
human soul.  It is in the soul that the battle rages every moment of 
life. He also believes that one should Start by doing what's necessary; 
then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. 
Because You learn to speak by speaking, to study by studying, to run by 
running, to work by working, and just so, you learn to love by loving.

<h4 class="speaker">Sean Dillon (zerosum0x0)<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Security Analyst,  RiskSense, Inc.</span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Zach Harding (Aleph-Naught-)<span class="speakerTitle">  Senior Security Analyst, RiskSense, Inc.</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Koadic C3, or COM Command &amp; Control, is a 
Windows post-exploitation tool similar to other penetration testing 
rootkits such as Meterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference
 is that Koadic does most of its operations using the Windows Script 
Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in the core to 
support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs 
(and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way through Windows 10.<br><br>

An in-depth view of default COM objects will be provided. COM is a 
fairly underexplored, large attack surface in Windows. We will share 
lots of weird Windows scripting quirks with interesting workarounds we 
discovered during the course of development. Post exploitation with 
PowerShell has grown in popularity in recent years, and seeing what can 
be done with just the basic Windows Script Host is an interesting 
exploration. In addition, defenses against this type of tool will be 
discussed, as the Windows Script Host is more tightly coupled to the 
core of Windows than PowerShell is.<br><br>

It is possible to serve payloads completely in memory from stage 0 to 
beyond, as well as use cryptographically secure communications over SSL 
and TLS (depending on what the victim OS has available). We also found 
numerous ways to "fork to shellcode" in an environment which 
traditionally does not provide such capabilities. This talk is based on 
original research by ourselves, as well as the previous amazing work of 
engima0x3, subTee, tiraniddo, and others.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Roger Dingledine<span class="speakerTitle"> The Tor Project</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Millions of people around the world use Tor every 
day to protect themselves from surveillance and censorship. While most 
people use Tor to reach ordinary websites more safely, a tiny fraction 
of Tor traffic makes up what overhyped journalists like to call the 
"dark web". Tor onion services (formerly known as Tor hidden services) 
let people run Internet services such as websites in a way where both 
the service and the people reaching it can get stronger security and 
privacy.<br><br>

I wrote the original onion service code as a toy example in 2004, and it
 sure is showing its age. In particular, mistakes in the original 
protocol are now being actively exploited by fear-mongering "threat 
intelligence" companies to build lists of onion services even when the 
service operators thought they would stay under the radar.<br><br>

These design flaws are a problem because people rely on onion services 
for many cool use cases, like metadata-free chat and file sharing, safe 
interaction between journalists and their sources, safe software 
updates, and more secure ways to reach popular websites like Facebook.<br><br>

In this talk I'll present our new and improved onion service design, 
which provides stronger security and better scalability. I'll also 
publish a new release of the Tor software that lets people use the new 
design.</p>

<p class="abstract">Is Net Neutrality on the up or down? Is DRM rising 
or falling? Is crypto being banned, or will it win, and if it does, will
 its major application be ransomware or revolution? Is the arc of 
history bending toward justice, or snapping abruptly and plummeting 
toward barbarism?<br><br>

It's complicated.<br><br>

A better world isn't a product, it's a process. The right question 
isn't, "Does the internet make us better or worse," its: "HOW DO WE MAKE
 AN INTERNET THAT MAKES THE WORLD BETTER?" We make the world better with
 code, sure, but also with conversations, with businesses, with lawsuits
 and with laws.<br><br>

We don't know how to get to a better world, but we know which direction 
it's in, and we know how to hill-climb towards it. If we keep heading 
that way, we'll get *somewhere*. Somewhere good. Somewhere imperfect. 
Somewhere where improvement is possible.</p>

<p class="abstract">A judge with preferences for hard core porn, a 
police officer investigating a cyber-crime, a politician ordering burn 
out medication - this kind of very personal and private information is 
on the market. Get sold to who is willing to pay for.<br><br>

In a long time experiment, with the help of some social engineering 
techniques, we were able to get our hands on the most private data you 
can find on the internet. Click stream data of three million German 
citizens. They contain every URL they have looked at, every second, 
every hour, every day for 31 days. In our talk we will not only show how
 we got that data, but how you can de-anonymize it with some simple 
techniques.<br><br>

This data is collected worldwide by big companies, whose legal purpose 
is to sell analytics and insights for marketers and businesses. In the 
shadow of Google and Facebook, companies have evolved, their names 
unknown to a broader public but making billions of dollars with your 
data. The new oil of the 20th century.<br><br>

Our experiment shows in a drastic way, what the youngest decision 
reversing the Broadband Privacy Rule means. What the consequences for 
everyday life could be, when ISPs are allowed to sell your browsing 
data. And why that piece of regulation from the FCC was so important 
regarding privacy and constitutional rights.</p>

	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Exploit</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Omar Eissa<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Analyst, ERNW GmbH</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Autonomic systems are smart systems which do not 
need any human management or intervention. Cisco is one of the first 
companies to deploy the technology in which the routers are just "Plug 
and Play" with no need for configuration. All that is needed is 5 
commands to build fully automated network. It is already supported in 
pretty much all of the recent software images for enterprise level and 
carrier grade routers/switches.<br><br>

This is the bright side of the technology. On the other hand, the 
configuration is hidden and the interfaces are inaccessible. The 
protocol is proprietary and there is no mechanism to know what is 
running within your network.<br><br>

In this talk, we will have a quick overview on Cisco's Autonomic Network
 Architecture, then I will reverse-engineer the proprietary protocol 
through its multiple phases. Finally, multiple vulnerabilities (overall 
5) will be presented, one of which allows to crash systems remotely by 
knowing their IPv6 address.</p>

<p class="abstract">Windows kernel exploitation is a difficult field to 
get into.  Learning the field well enough to write your own exploits 
require full walkthroughs and few of those exist. This talk will do 
that, release two exploits and a new GDI object abuse technique.<br><br>

We will provide all the detailed steps taken to develop a full privilege
 escalation exploit. The process includes reversing a Microsoft's patch,
 identifying and analyzing two bugs, developing PoCs to trigger them, 
turning them into code execution and then putting it all together. The 
result is an exploit for Windows 8.1 x64 using GDI bitmap objects and a 
new, previously unreleased Windows 7 SP1 x86 exploit involving the abuse
 of a newly discovered GDI object abuse technique.</p>

<p class="abstract">Let's face it, software security is still in pretty 
bad shape.  We could tell ourselves that everything is fine, but in our 
hearts, we know the world is on fire.  Even as hackers, it's incredibly 
hard to know whether your computer, phone, or secure messaging app is 
pwned. Of course, there's a Solution(tm) - hardware security devices.<br><br>

We carry authentication tokens not only to secure our banking and 
corporate VPN connections, but also to access everything from cloud 
services to social networking. While we've isolated these 'trusted' 
hardware components from our potentially pwnd systems so that they might
 be more reliable, we will present scenarios against two popular 
hardware tokens where their trust can be easily undermined. After 
building our modified and counterfeit devices, we can use them to 
circumvent intended security assumptions made by their designers and 
users. In addition to covering technical details about our modifications
 and counterfeit designs, we'll explore a few attack scenarios for each.<br><br>

Sharing is Caring, so after showing off a few demonstration, we'll walk 
you through the process of rolling your own Secure Tokin' and Doobiekey 
that you can pass around the circle at your next cryptoparty.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Secret Tools: Learning about Government Surveillance Software You Can't Ever See </h3>
	<p class="abstract">Friday at 10:00 in Track 4</p>	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | 0025</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Peyton "Foofus" Engel<span class="speakerTitle"> Attorney at Hurley, Burish &amp; Stanton, S.C.</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Imagine that you're accused of a crime, and the 
basis of the accusation is a log entry generated by a piece of custom 
software.  You might have some questions: does the software work?  how 
accurate is it?  how did it get the results that it did?  Unfortunately,
 the software isn't available to the public.  And you can't get access 
to the source code or even a working instance of the software.  All you 
get are assurances that the software is in use by investigators around 
the globe, and doesn't do anything that law enforcement isn't supposed 
to be doing.  Because you can trust the government, right?<br><br>

This talk will look at a family of tools designed for investigating 
peer-to- peer networks.  By synthesizing information from dozens of 
search warrant affidavits, and a few technical sources, we're able to 
put together at least a partial picture of the software's capabilities. 
 But we'll also look at the reasons the government offers for keeping 
these tools out of the public eye and talk about whether they make 
sense.  Finally, we'll examine the implications that investigations 
based on secret capabilities have for justice.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Peyton "Foofus" Engel</strong><br> After 
18 years in IT, with 16 of those years spent in security and penetration
 testing, Foofus now works as an attorney.  But because he's got 
significant experience with the Internet and security, one area of his 
practice focuses on consulting with litigants where digital evidence is 
at stake.  In this capacity he does forensic analysis and assists other 
attorneys with strategy for presenting (or calling into question) 
computer-based evidence.  In his spare time, Foofus enjoys cooking, 
playing guitar, and opera.  Oh, and remember CoffeeWars?  Foofus was 
pretty involved with that</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Call the plumber - you have a leak in your (named) pipe</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 14:00 in 101 Track</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Gil Cohen<span class="speakerTitle"> CTO, Comsec group</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">The typical security professional is largely 
unfamiliar with the Windows named pipes interface, or considers it to be
 an internal-only communication interface. <br>As a result, open RPC 
(135) or SMB (445) ports are typically considered potentially entry 
points in "infrastructure" penetration tests.<br><br>

However, named pipes can in fact be used as an application-level entry 
vector for well known attacks such as buffer overflow, denial of service
 or even code injection attacks and XML bombs, depending on the nature 
of listening service to the specific pipe on the target machine.<br><br>

As it turns out, it seems that many popular and widely used Microsoft 
Windows-based enterprise applications open a large number of named pipes
 on each endpoint or server on which they are deployed, significantly 
increase an environment's attack surface without the organization or end
 user being aware of the risk. <br>Since there's a complete lack of 
awareness to the entry point, there's very limited options available to 
organizations to mitigate it, making it a perfect attack target for the 
sophisticated attacker.<br><br>

In this presentation we will highlight how named pipes have become a 
neglected and forgotten external interface. We will show some tools that
 can help find vulnerable named pipes, discuss the mitigations, and 
demonstrate the exploitation process on a vulnerable interface.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Gil Cohen</strong><br> Gil is an 
experienced application security instructor, architect, consultant and 
pentester just starting his 12th year in the field. <br><br>

With past experience in the civilian, government and military cyber 
security industries, Gil currently serves as the CTO of Comsec Group, in
 charge of training, research, service lines, methodologies and quality 
assurance.<br><br>

With a long time record as an SQL injection fanatic, Gil was responsible
 for publishing the "SQL Injection Anywhere" technique in 2010, which is
 currently in use in a variety of automated scanners in the market, and 
enables the blind detection and exploitation of potential injections in 
any part of the SQL statement.<br><br>

<h4 class="speaker">Denton Gentry<span class="speakerTitle"> Software Engineer</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Existing fingerprinting mechanisms to identify 
client devices on a network tend to be coarse in their identification. 
For example they can tell it is an iPhone of some kind, or that it is a 
Samsung Android device of some model. They might look at DHCP 
information to know its OS, see if the client responds to SSDP, or check
 DNS-SD TXT responses.<br><br>

By examining Wi-Fi Management frames we can identify the device much 
more specifically. We can tell a iPhone 5S from an iPhone 5, a Samsung 
Galaxy S8 from an S7, an LG G5 from a G4. This talk describes how the 
signature mechanism works.<br><br>

Specifically identifying the client is the first step toward further

<p class="abstract">What if you could super-charge your web hacking? Not
 through pure automation (since it can miss so much) but through 
powerful alerts created from real threat intelligence? What if you had a
 Burp plugin that did this for you? What if that plugin not only told 
you where to look for vulns but also gave you curated resources for 
additional exploitation and methodology? What if you could organize your
 web hacking methodology inside of your tools? Well, now you do! HUNT is
 a new Burp Suite extension that aims to arm web hackers with parameter 
level suggestions on where to look for certain classes of 
vulnerabilities (SQLi, CMDi, LFI/RFI, and more!). This data is parsed 
from hundreds of real-world assessments, providing the user with the 
means to effectively root out critical issues. Not only will HUNT help 
you assess large targets more thoroughly but it also aims to organize 
common web hacking methodologies right inside of Burp suite.  As an open
 source project, we will go over the data driven design of HUNT and it's
 core functionality. </p>

<p class="abstract">Law enforcement agencies have used aircraft for 
decades to conduct surveillance, but modern radio, camera, and 
electronics technology has dramatically expanded the power and scope of 
police surveillance capabilities. The Iraq War and other conflicts have 
spurred the development of mass surveillance technologies and techniques
 that are now widely available to domestic police. The FBI, DEA, and 
other agencies flew powerful surveillance aircraft over cities for years
 in relative secrecy before breaking in to public attention in 2015. 
This presentation will discuss the capabilities of these aircraft, the 
discovery of the FBI and others' surveillance fleets, and continued 
efforts to shed light on aerial surveillance. We will discuss a method 
for detecting surveillance indicators in real time based on 
mutilateration of aggregated ADS-B data, and introduce code for

<h4 class="speaker">Stephan Huber<span class="speakerTitle"> Fraunhofer SIT</span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Siegfried Rasthofer<span class="speakerTitle"> Fraunhofer SIT</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Security experts recommend using different, complex 
passwords for individual services, but everybody knows the issue arising
 from this approach: It is impossible to keep all the complex passwords 
in mind. One solution to this issue are password managers, which aim to 
provide a secure, centralized storage for credentials. The rise of 
mobile password managers even allows the user to carry their credentials
 in their pocket, providing instant access to these credentials if 
required. This advantage can immediately turn into a disadvantage as all
 credentials are stored in one central location. What happens if your 
device gets lost, stolen or a hacker gets access to your device? Are 
your personal secrets and credentials secure?<br><br>

We say no! In our recent analysis of well-known Android password manager
 apps, amongst them are vendors such as LastPass, Dashlane, 1Password, 
Avast, and several others, we aimed to bypass their security by either 
stealing the master password or by directly accessing the stored 
credentials. Implementation flaws resulted in severe security 
vulnerabilities. In all of those cases, no root permissions were 
required for a successful attack. We will explain our attacks in detail.
 We will also propose possible security fixes and recommendations on how
 to avoid the vulnerabilities.</p>

vulnerability of democratic institutions, the media, and civil society? 
 Then come engage with your peers and the first US National Intelligence
 Officer for Cyber Issues on ways to hack democracy.  He will: (1) 
provide a low-tech, strategic analysis of recent events, foreign 
intelligence threats, and the future of information warfare; (2) lead a 
Socratic dialogue with attendees about the trade-offs between national 
security and core democratic values (such as freedom, equality, and 
privacy); and (3) open the floor to audience questions and/or a 
moderated group debate.<br><br>

This session is intended to be informal and participatory.  It will 
cover a range of issues from supply chain attacks on voting machines to 
psychological operations by using an interdisciplinary approach that 
encompasses constitutional law, world history, game theory, social 
engineering, and international affairs.  The discussion will occur 
against the backdrop of cyber security and critical infrastructure 
protection, but it will not examine any specific hardware or software 
systems; rather, it will concern the conceptual formulation and conduct 
of modern strategic influence campaigns.  No specific knowledge is 
required, but a skeptical mind and mischievous intellect are a must.   </p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Hacking Democracy: A Socratic Dialogue</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Friday at 12:00 in Track 4</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Mr. Sean Kanuck<span class="speakerTitle"> Stanford University, Center for International Security and Cooperation</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">In the wake of recent presidential elections in the 
US and France, "hacking" has taken on new political and social 
dimensions around the globe.  We are now faced with a world of complex 
influence operations and dubious integrity of information.  What does 
that imply for democratic institutions, legitimacy, and public 
confidence?<br><br>

This session will explore how liberal democracy can be hacked â ranging 
from direct manipulation of electronic voting tallies or voter 
registration lists to indirect influence over mass media and voter 
preferences â and question the future role of "truth" in open societies.
  Both domestic partisan activities and foreign interventions will be 
considered on technical, legal, and philosophical grounds.  The speaker 
will build on his experience as an intelligence professional to analyze 
foreign capabilities and intentions in the cyber sphere in order to 
forecast the future of information warfare.  Audience members will be 
engaged in a Socratic dialogue to think through how modern technologies 
can be used to propagate memes and influence the electorate. The 
feasibility of, and public policy challenges associated with, various 
approaches to hacking democracy will also be considered.  This 
conceptual discussion of strategic influence campaigns will not require 
any specific technical or legal knowledge</p>

	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Konstantinos Karagiannis<span class="speakerTitle">  Chief Technology Officer, Security Consulting, BT Americas</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">It can be argued that the DAO hack of June 2016 was 
the moment smart contracts entered mainstream awareness in the InfoSec 
community. Was the hope of taking blockchain from mere cryptocurrency 
platform to one that can perform amazing Turing-complete functions 
doomed? We've learned quite a lot from that attack against contract 
code, and Ethereum marches on. Smart contracts are a key part of the 
applications being created by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Quorum, 
and smaller projects in financial and other companies. Ethical hacking 
of smart contracts is a critical new service that is needed. And as is 
the case with coders of Solidity (the language of Ethereum smart 
contracts), hackers able to find security flaws in the code are in high 
demand.<br><br>

Join Konstantinos for an introduction to a methodology that can be 
applied to Solidity code review ... and potentially adapted to other 
smart contract projects. We'll examine the few tools that are needed, as
 well as the six most common types of flaws, illustrated using either 
public or sanitized real world" vulnerabilities.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Garry Kasparov<span class="speakerTitle"> Avast Security Ambassador</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov has a 
unique place in history as the proverbial "man" in "man vs. machine" 
thanks to his iconic matches against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. 
Kasparov walked away from that watershed moment in artificial 
intelligence history with a passion for finding ways humans and 
intelligent machines could work together. In the spirit of "if you can't
 beat'em, join'em," Kasparov has explored that potential for the 20 
years since his loss to Deep Blue. Navigating a practical and hopeful 
approach between the utopian and dystopian camps, Kasparov focuses on 
how we can rise to the challenge of the AI revolution despite job losses
 to automation and refuting those who say our technology is making us 
less human. He includes concrete examples and forward-looking strategies
 on AI.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Garry Kasparov</strong><br> Garry Kasparov
 was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the Soviet Union in 1963. He became 
the youngest world chess champion in history in 1985 and was the world's
 top-rated player for 20 years, until he retired in 2005. His matches 
against arch-rival Anatoly Karpov and the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue 
popularized chess and machine intelligence in unprecedented ways. 
Kasparov became a pro-democracy leader in Russia and an outspoken 
defender of individual freedom around the world, a mission he continues 
as the chairman of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation. He is a 
Visiting Fellow at the Oxford-Martin School, where his lectures focus on
 human-machine collaboration. Kasparov is a provocative speaker who 
appears frequently before business, academic, and political audiences to
 speak about decision-making, strategy, technology, and artificial 
intelligence. His influential writings on politics, cognition, and tech 
have appeared in dozens of major publications around the world. He has 
written two acclaimed series of chess books and the bestsellers How Life
 Imitates Chess on decision-making and Winter Is Coming on Russia and 
Vladimir Putin. His new book, Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence 
Ends and Human Creativity Begins comes out in May 2017. In 2016, he was 
named a Security Ambassador by Avast, where he discusses cybersecurity 
and the digital future. He lives in New York City with his wife Dasha

<p class="abstract">Translators are invisible, when they are present it 
is assumed that they know the language and are accurately translating 
between the languages. But how do you assure that the translator is 
accurately translating or working without an agenda? Although many of 
the case studies presented in this talk will  focus on translating 
between different languages, the basic premise can be applied in any 
case where information needs to be shared among 2 or more different 
contexts. (i.e.: Sales vs Engineering, Government vs Private sector etc)
 . The talk will showcase publicly known historical cases and personal 
experiences where translation errors (accidental and deliberate) have 
lead to misunderstandings some with dire consequences. Also the talk 
will showcase using translators as an offensive tool (i.e.:How to create
 more credible fake news). We as a society consume more information and 
consume it faster than before, we have to be aware of the dangers that 
are inherit with bad translations. Also the infosec/cyber security 
profession because of the potential for large scale global impacts  and 
or the need to maintain operational security poses unique considerations
 when translating or using a translator. This talk will highlight the 
unique challenges of using a translator or translations in such 
environments.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Marc Newlin<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Researcher at Bastille</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">What do the Dallas tornado siren attack, hacked 
electric skateboards, and insecure smart door locks have in common? 
Vulnerable wireless protocols. Exploitation of wireless devices is 
growing increasingly common, thanks to the proliferation of radio 
frequency protocols driven by mobile and IoT. While non-Wi-Fi and 
non-Bluetooth RF protocols remain a mystery to many security 
practitioners, exploiting them is easier than one might think.<br><br>

Join us as we walk through the fundamentals of radio exploitation. After
 introducing essential RF concepts and characteristics, we will develop a
 wireless threat taxonomy by analyzing and classifying different methods
 of attack. As we introduce each new attack, we will draw parallels to 
similar wired network exploits, and highlight attack primitives that are
 unique to RF. To illustrate these concepts, we will show each attack in
 practice with a series of live demos built on software-defined and 
hardware radios.<br><br>

Attendees will come away from this session with an understanding of the 
mechanics of wireless network exploitation, and an awareness of how they
 can bridge their IP network exploitation skills to the wireless domain.</p>

	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">William Knowles<span class="speakerTitle"> MWR InfoSecurity</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">One software product that red teamers will almost 
certainly find on any compromised workstation is Microsoft Office.  This
 talk will discuss the ways that native functionality within Office can 
be abused to obtain persistence.  The following opportunities for 
Office-based persistence will be discussed:<br><br>

    (1) WLL and XLL add-ins for Word and Excel - a legacy add-in that allows arbitrary DLL loading.<br>
    (2) VBA add-ins for Excel and PowerPoint - an alternative to 
backdoored template files, which executes whenever the applications 
load.<br>    (3) COM add-ins for all Office products - an older cross-application add-in that leverages COM objects.<br>    (4) Automation add-ins for Excel - user defined functions that allow command execution through spreadsheet formulae.<br>
    (5) VBA editor (VBE) add-ins for all VBA using Office products - 
executing commands when someone tries to catch you using VBA to execute 
commands.<br>    (6) VSTO add-ins for all Office products - the newer 
cross-application add-in that leverages a special Visual Studio runtime.<br><br>

Each persistence mechanism will be discussed in terms of its relative 
advantages and disadvantages for red teamers.  In particular, with 
regards to their complexity to deploy, privilege requirements, and 
applicability to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments which
 hinder the use of many traditional persistence mechanisms.<br><br>

The talk isn't all red - there's also some blue to satisfy the threat 
hunters and incident responders amongst us. The talk will finish with 
approaches to detection and prevention of these persistence mechanisms.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Artem Kondratenko<span class="speakerTitle"> Penetration Tester, Security Researcher</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">On March 17th, Cisco Systems Inc. made a public 
announcement that over 300 of the switches it manufactures are prone to a
 critical vulnerability that allows a potential attacker to take full 
control of the network equipment.<br><br>

This damaging public announcement was preceded by Wikileaks' publication
 of documents codenamed as "Vault 7" which contained information on 
vulnerabilities and description of tools needed to access phones, 
network equipment and even IOT devices.<br><br>

Cisco Systems Inc. had a huge task in front of them - patching this vast
 amount of different switch models is not an easy task. The remediation 
for this vulnerability was available with the initial advisory and 
patched versions of IOS software were announced on May 8th 2017.<br><br>

We all heard about modern exploit mitigation techniques such as Data 
Execution Prevention, Layout Randomization. But just how hardened is the
 network equipment? And how hard is it to find critical vulnerabilities?
 <br><br>

To answer that question I decided to reproduce the steps necessary to 
create a fully working tool to get remote code execution on Cisco 
switches mentioned in the public announcement.<br><br>

This presentation is a detailed write-up of the exploit development 
process for the vulnerability in Cisco Cluster Management Protocol that 
allows a full takeover of the device.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Amit Klein<span class="speakerTitle"> VP Security Research, SafeBreach</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Everyone loves cloud-AV. Why not harness the wisdom 
of clouds to protect the enterprise? Consider a high-security enterprise
 with strict egress filtering - endpoints have no direct Internet 
connection, or the endpoints' connection to the Internet is restricted 
to hosts used by their legitimately installed software. Let's say 
there's malware running on an endpoint with full privileges. The malware
 still can't exfiltrate data due to the strict egress filtering.<br><br>

Now let'also assume that this enterprise uses cloud-enhanced anti-virus 
(AV).You'd argue that if malware is already running on the endpoint with
 full privileges, then an AV agent can't degrade the security of the 
endpoint. And you'd be completely wrong.<br><br>

In this presentation, we describe and demonstrate a novel technique for 
exfiltrating data from highly secure enterprises which employ strict 
egress filtering. Assuming the endpoint has a cloud-enhanced antivirus 
installed, we show that if the AV employs an Internet-connected sandbox 
in its cloud, it in fact facilitates such exfiltration. We release a 
tool implementing the exfiltration technique, and provide real-world 
results from several prominent AV products. We also provide insights on 
AV in-the-cloud sandboxes. Finally we address the issues of how to 
further enhance the attack, and possible mitigations.</p>

<p class="abstract">In the past few years, attacks against industrial 
control systems (ICS) have increased year over year. Stuxnet in 2010 
exploited the insecurity of the S7Comm protocol, the communication 
protocol used between Siemens Simatic S7 PLCs to cause serious damage in
 nuclear power facilities. After the exposure of Stuxnet, Siemens has 
implemented some security reinforcements into the S7Comm protocol. The 
current S7CommPlus protocol implementing encryption has been used in 
S7-1200 V4.0 and above, as well as S7-1500, to prevent attackers from 
controlling and damaging the PLC devices. <br>Is the current S7CommPlus a
 real high security protocol? This talk will demonstrate a spear that 
can break the security wall of the S7CommPlus protocol. First, we use 
software like Wireshark to analyze the communications between the 
Siemens TIA Portal and PLC devices. Then, using reverse debugging 
software like WinDbg and IDA we can break the encryption in the 
S7CommPlus protocol. Finally, we write a MFC program which can control 
the start and the stop of the PLC, as well as value changes of PLC's 
digital and analog inputs &amp; outputs.<br>Based on the research above,
 we present two security proposals at both code level and protocol level
 to improve the security of Siemens PLC devices.</p>

 We tackle the difficult problem of finding the function, owners and 
locations of these devices using OSINT and Maltego. The result is a one 
click sequence of transforms that makes finding interesting ICS devices 
child's play. In the 'embarrassing' section we look at how network 
footprinting (which we've refined to an art in Maltego) becomes useful 
for identifying and profiling people who's job description involves lots
 of lies and who probably does not want to be associated with the data

<h3 class="talkTitle">Malicious CDNs: Identifying Zbot Domains en Masse via SSL Certificates and Bipartite Graphs</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 13:00 in Track 3</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Art of Defense</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Thomas Mathew<span class="speakerTitle"> OpenDNS (Cisco)</span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Dhia Mahjoub <span class="speakerTitle"> Head of Security Research, Cisco Umbrella (OpenDNS)</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Prior research detailing the relationship between 
malware, bulletproof hosting, and SSL gave researchers methods to 
investigate SSL data only if given a set of seed domains.  We present a 
novel statistical technique that allow us to discover botnet and 
bulletproof hosting IP space by examining SSL distribution patterns from
 open source data while working with limited or no seed information. 
This work can be accomplished using open source datasets and data tools.<br><br>

SSL data obtained from scanning the entire IPv4 namespace can be 
represented as a series of 4 million node bipartite graphs where a 
common name is connected to either an IP/CIDR/ASN via an edge. We use 
the concept of relative entropy to create a pairwise distance metric 
between any two common names and any two ASNs. The metric allows us to 
generalize the concept of regular and anomalous SSL distribution 
patterns.   <br><br>

Relative entropy is useful in identifying domains that have anomalous 
network structures. The domains we found in this case were related to 
the Zbot proxy network. The Zbot proxy network contains a structure 
similar to popular CDNs like Akamai, Google, etc but instead rely on 
compromised devices to relay their data. Through layering these SSL 
signals with passive DNS data we create a pipeline that can extract Zbot
 domains with high accuracy.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Trojan-tolerant Hardware &amp; Supply Chain Security in Practice</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Saturday at 14:00 in Track 2</p>

<p class="abstract">The current consensus within the security industry 
is that high-assurance systems cannot tolerate the presence of 
compromised hardware components. In this talk, we challenge this 
perception and demonstrate how trusted, high-assurance hardware can be 
built from untrusted and potentially malicious components.<br><br>

The majority of IC vendors outsource the fabrication of their designs to
 facilities overseas, and rely on post-fabrication tests to weed out 
deficient chips. However, such tests are not effective against: 1) 
subtle unintentional errors (e.g., malfunctioning RNGs) and 2) malicious
 circuitry (e.g., stealthy Hardware Trojans). Such errors are very hard 
to detect and require constant upgrades of expensive forensics 
equipment, which contradicts the motives of fabrication outsourcing.<br><br>

In this session, we introduce a high-level architecture that can 
tolerate multiple, malicious hardware components, and outline a new 
approach in hardware compromises risk management. We first demo our 
backdoor-tolerant Hardware Security Module built from low-cost 
commercial off-the-shelf components, benchmark its performance, and 
delve into its internals. We then explain the importance of "component 
diversification" and "non-overlapping supply chains", and finally 
discuss how "mutual distrust" can be exploited to further reduce the 
capabilities of the adversaries.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Exploiting 0ld Mag-stripe information with New technology</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Thursday at 15:20 in 101 Track 2</p>
	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Salvador Mendoza<span class="speakerTitle"> Hacker</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">A massive attack against old magnetic stripe 
information could be executed with precision implementing new 
technology. In the past, a malicious individual could spoof magstripe 
data but in a slow and difficult way. Also brute force attacks were 
tedious and time-consuming. Technology like Bluetooth could be used 
today to make a persistent attack in multiple magnetic card readers at 
the same time with audio spoof.<br><br>

Private companies, banks, trains, subways, hotels, schools and many 
others services are still using magstripe information to even make 
monetary transactions, authorize access or to generate "new" protocols 
like MST(Magnetic Secure Transmission) During decades the exploitation 
of magstripe information was an acceptable risk for many companies 
because the difficulty to achieve massive attacks simultaneously was not
 factible. But today is different.<br><br>

Transmitting magstripe information in audio files is the faster and 
easier way to make a cross-platform magstripe spoofer. But how an 
attacker could transmit the audio spoof information to many magnetic 
card readers at the same time? In this talk, we will discuss how an 
attacker could send specific data or achieve a magstripe jammer for 
credit card terminals, PoS or any card reader. Also, how it could be 
implemented to generate brute force attacks against hotel door locks or 
tokenization processes as examples.</p>

<p class="abstract">2016 was the year of Java deserialization 
apocalypse. Although Java Deserialization attacks were known for years, 
the publication of the Apache Commons Collection Remote Code Execution 
(RCE from now on) gadget finally brought this forgotten vulnerability to
 the spotlight and motivated the community to start finding and fixing 
these issues.<br><br>

One of the most suggested solutions for avoiding Java deserialization 
issues was to move away from Java Deserialization altogether and use 
safer formats such as JSON. In this talk, we will analyze the most 
popular JSON parsers in both .NET and Java for potential RCE vectors.<br><br>

We will demonstrate that RCE is also possible in these libraries and 
present details about the ones that are vulnerable to RCE by default. We
 will also discuss common configurations that make other libraries 
vulnerable.<br><br>

In addition to focusing on JSON format, we will generalize the attack 
techniques to other serialization formats. In particular, we will pay 
close attention to several serialization formats in .NET. These formats 
have also been known to be vulnerable since 2012 but the lack of known 
RCE gadgets led some software vendors to not take this issue seriously. 
We hope this talk will change this. With the intention of bringing the 
due attention to this vulnerability class in .NET, we will review the 
known vulnerable formats, present other formats which we found to be 
vulnerable as well and conclude presenting several gadgets from system 
libraries that may be used to achieve RCE in a stable way: no memory 
corruption â just simple process invocation.<br><br>

Finally, we will provide recommendations on how to determine if your 
code is vulnerable, provide remediation advice, and discuss alternative 
approaches.</p>

<p class="abstract">Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and, more generally, 
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) wireless communications enable 
semi-autonomous driving via the exchange of state information between a 
network of connected vehicles and infrastructure units. Following 10+ 
years of standards development, particularly of IEEE 802.11p and the 
IEEE 1609 family, a lack of available implementations has prevented the 
involvement of the security community in development and testing of 
these standards. Analysis of the WAVE/DSRC protocols in their existing 
form reveals the presence of vulnerabilities which have the potential to
 render the protocol unfit for use in safety-critical systems. We 
present a complete Linux-stack based implementation of IEEE 802.11p and 
IEEE 1609.3/4 which provide a means for hackers and academics to 
participate in the engineering of secure standards for intelligent 
transportation systems.</p>

recently having joined forces with friends and mentors to organize and 
host the DEF CON  Car Hacking Village.<br><br>

p3n3troot0r began working V2X with ginsback two years ago and realized 
the opportunity, in lieu of any open-source or full-stack V2X 
implementation, to bring the security community in to the driver's seat 
in the development of next-gen cyberauto standards. Together they have 
engaged the thought leaders in this space, and via the long-awaited 
integration of this stack into the mainline Linux kernel, the global 
development community is given the opportunity to participate in the 
development of automated and connected transportation systems.</p>

Given the (abyssal) state of automotive cybersecurity, ginsback aims to 
develop and field tools for V2X that open collaboration with the hacker 
community. As intelligent transit reaches critical mass, attacks on V2X 
infrastructure have the potential to cause incredible damage. ginsback 
partnered with p3n3troot0r to develop a free as in freedom V2X interface

fired only by authorized parties. That works in the movies, but what 
about in real life? In this talk, we explore the security of one of the

will be demonstrated. First, we will show how to make the weapon fire 
even when separated from its owner by a considerable distance. Second, 
we will show how to prevent the weapon from firing even when authorized 
by its owner. Third, we will show how to fire the weapon even when not 
authorized by its owner, with no prior contact with the specific weapon,
 and with no modifications to the weapon.</p>

<p class="abstract">Every year thousands of organizations are 
compromised by targeted attacks. In many cases the attacks are labeled 
as advanced and persistent which suggests a high level of sophistication
 in the attack and tools used. Many times, this title is leveraged as an
 excuse that the events were inevitable or irresistible, as if the 
assailants' skill set is well beyond what defenders are capable of. To 
the contrary, often these assailants are not as untouchable as many 
would believe. <br><br>

If one looks at the many APT reports that have been released over the 
years some clear patterns start to emerge. A small number of Remote 
Administration Tools are preferred by actors and reused across multiple 
campaigns. Frequently sited tools include Gh0st RAT, Plug-X, and 
XtremeRAT among others. Upon examination, the command and control 
components of these notorious RATs are riddled with vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to turn the tables from hunter to 
hunted.<br><br>

The presentation will disclose several exploits that could allow remote 
execution or remote information disclosure on computers running these 
well-known C&amp;C components. It should serve as a warning to those 
actors who utilize such toolsets. That is to say, such actors live in 
glass houses and should stop throwing stones.</p>

<p class="abstract">Women's health is big business. There are a 
staggering number of applications for Android to help people keep track 
of their monthly cycle, know when they may be fertile, or track the 
status of their pregnancy. These apps entice the user to input the most 
intimate details of their lives, such as their mood, sexual activity, 
physical activity, physical symptoms, height, weight, and more. But how 
private are these apps, and how secure are they really? After all, if an
 app has such intimate details about our private lives it would make 
sense to ensure that it is not sharing those details with anyone such as
 another company or an abusive partner/parent. To this end EFF and 
Journalist Kashmir Hill have taken a look at some of the privacy and 
security properties of over a dozen different fertility and pregnancy 
tracking apps. Through our research we have uncovered several privacy 
issues in many of the applications as well as some notable security 
flaws as well as a couple of interesting security features.</p>

<p class="abstract">The late 80's and early 90's played a pivotal role 
in the forming of the Israeli tech scene as we know it today, producing 
companies like Checkpoint, Waze, Wix, Mobileye, Viber and billions of 
dollars in fundraising and exits. The people who would later build that 
industry were in anywhere from elementary school to high school, and 
their paths included some of the best hacking stories of the time 
(certainly in the eyes of the locals). The combination of extremely 
expensive Internet and international dial system, non-existent legal 
enforcement and a lagging national phone company could not prevent 
dozens of hungry-for-knowledge kids from teaching themselves the dark 
arts of reversing, hacking, cracking, phreaking and even carding. The 
world looked completely different back then and we have some great 
stories for you. We will cover the evolution of the 
many-years-later-to-be-named-Cyber community, including personal stories
 from nearly all categories. Come listen how the Israeli Cyber "empire" 
was born, 25 years ago, from the perspectives of 2:401/100 and 
2:401/100.1.</p>

 with a screwdriver, pliers, wire cutters, and his grandfather's ECG 
machine, and gradually transitioned into less destructive research. In 
1984, aged 9, he started programming on his Dragon 64. At 13 he got his 
first PC - Amstrad PC1512 - and within a year was already into reverse 
engineering. It wasn't long before he discovered how to access the X.25 
network, Bitnet and Fidonet, and through high-school he was a key figure
 in the Israeli BBS scene.<br><br>

Inbar spent most of his career in the Internet and Data Security field, 
and the only reason he's not in jail right now is because he chose the 
right side of the law at an early age. In fact, nowadays he commonly 
lectures about Ethical Hacking and Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.<br><br>

<h4 class="speaker">Andy Robbins<span class="speakerTitle"> Red Team Lead</span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Will Schroeder <span class="speakerTitle"> Offensive Engineer</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Active Directory (AD) object discretionary access 
control lists (DACLs) are an untapped offensive landscape, often 
overlooked by attackers and defenders alike. The control relationships 
between AD objects align perfectly with the "attackers think in graphs" 
philosophy and expose an entire class of previously unseen control 
edges, dramatically expanding the number of paths to complete domain 
compromise.<br><br>

While DACL misconfigurations can provide numerous paths that facilitate 
elevation of domain rights, they also present a unique chance to 
covertly deploy Active Directory persistence. It's often difficult to 
determine whether a specific AD DACL misconfiguration was set 
intentionally or implemented by accident. This makes Active Directory 
DACL backdoors an excellent persistence opportunity: minimal forensic 
footprint, and maximum plausible deniability.<br><br>

This talk will cover Active Directory DACLs in depth, our 
"misconfiguration taxonomy", and enumeration/analysis with BloodHound's 
newly released feature set. We will cover the abuse of AD DACL 
misconfigurations for the purpose of domain rights elevation, including 
common misconfigurations encountered in the wild. We will then cover 
methods to design AD DACL backdoors, including ways to evade current 
detections, and will conclude with defensive mitigation/detection 
techniques for everything described.</p>

	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Art of Defense, Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Joe Rozner<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Software Security Engineer, Prevoty</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">CSRF remains an elusive problem due to legacy code, 
legacy frameworks, and developers not understanding the problem or how 
to protect against it. Wiping out CSRF introduces primitives and 
strategies for building solutions to CSRF that can be bolted on to any 
http application where http requests and responses can be intercepted, 
inspected, and modified. Modern frameworks have done a great job at 
providing solutions to the CSRF problem that automatically integrate 
into the application and solve most of the conditions. However, many 
existing apps and new apps that don't take advantage of these frameworks
 or use them incorrectly are still plagued with this problem. Wiping out
 CSRF will provide an in depth overview of the various reasons that CSRF
 occurs and provide payload examples to target those specific issues and
 variations. We'll see live demos of these attacks and the protections 
against them. Next we'll look at how to compose these primitives into a 
complete solution capable of solving most cases of CSRF explaining the 
limits and how to layer them to address potential short comings. Finally
 we'll finish by looking at Same Site Cookies, a new extension to 
cookies that could be the final nail in the coffin, and see how to use 
the prior solution as a graceful degradation for user agents that don't 
support it yet.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Gabriel "solstice" Ryan<span class="speakerTitle"> Gotham Digital Science</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Most forms of WPA2-EAP have been broken for nearly a
 decade. EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP have long been susceptible to evil twin 
attacks, yet most enterprise organizations still rely on these 
technologies to secure their wireless infrastructure. The reason for 
this is that the secure alternative, EAP-TLS, is notoriously arduous to 
implement. To compensate for the weak perimeter security provided by 
EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP, many organizations use port based NAC appliances 
to prevent attackers from pivoting further into the network after the 
wireless has been breached. This solution is thought to provide an 
acceptable balance between security and accessibility. The problem with 
this approach is that it assumes that EAP is exclusively a perimeter 
defense mechanism. In this presentation, we will present a novel type of
 rogue access point attack that can be used to bypass port-based access 
control mechanisms in wireless networks. In doing so, we will challenge 
the assumption that reactive approaches to wireless security are an 
acceptable alternative to strong physical layer protections such as 
WPA2-EAP using EAP-TLS.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Morten Schenk<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Advisor, Improsec</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Since the release of Windows 10 and especially in 
the Anniversary and Creators Updates, Microsoft has continued to 
introduce exploit mitigations to the Windows kernel. These include full 
scale KASLR and blocking kernel pointer leaks.<br><br>

This presentation picks up the mantle and reviews the powerful read and 
write kernel primitives that can still be leveraged despite the most 
recent hardening mitigations. The presented techniques include abusing 
the kernel-mode Window and Bitmap objects, which Microsoft has attempted
 to lock down several times. Doing so will present a generic approach to
 leveraging write-what-where vulnerabilities.<br><br>

A stable and precise kernel exploit must be able to overcome KASLR, most
 often using kernel driver leaks. I will disclose several previously 
unknown KASLR bypasses in Windows 10 Creators Update. Obtaining 
kernel-mode code execution on Windows has become more difficult with the
 randomization of Page Table entries. I will show how a generic 
de-randomization of the Page Table entries can be performed through 
dynamic reverse engineering. Additionally, I will present an entirely 
different method which makes the usage of Page Table entries obsolete. 
This method allocates an arbitrary size piece of executable kernel pool

<p class="abstract">What is cognitive memory? How can you "implant" a 
password into it? Is this truly secure? Curiosity around these questions
 prompted exploration of the research and concepts surrounding the idea 
of making the authentication process more secure by implanting passwords
 into an individual's memory. The result? The idea is that you are not 
able to reveal your credentials under duress but you are still able to 
authenticate to a system. We will begin with an understanding of 
cognitive memory. Implicit versus explicit memory will be defined. The 
concepts of the subconscious, unconscious, and consciousness will be 
addressed. The stages of memory pertaining to encoding, storage and 
retrieval as well as the limitations of human memory along with serial 
interception sequence learning training will round out our build up to

<p class="abstract">We've built a $200 open source robot that cracks 
combination safes using a mixture of measuring techniques and set

of the digits of the combination needed to open a standard fire safe. 
Additionally, 'set testing' is a new method we created to decrease the

<p class="abstract">NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is widely 
used in security, bank, payment and personal information exchange fields
 now, which is highly well-developed. Corresponding, the attacking 
methods against NFC are also emerged in endlessly.  To solve this 
problem, we built a hardware tool which we called "UniProxy". This tool 
contains two self-modified high frequency card readers and two radio 
transmitters, which is a master-slave way. The master part can help 
people easily and successfully read almost all ISO 14443A type cards, 
(no matter what kind of this card is, bank card, ID card, Passport, 
access card, or whatever. No matter what security protocol this card 
uses, as long as it meets the ISO 14443A standard) meanwhile replaying 
this card to corresponding legal card reader via slave part to achieve 
our "evil" goals. The master and slave communicate with radio 
transmitters and can be apart between 50 - 200 meters.</p>

<p class="abstract">You are on the inside of the perimeter. And maybe 
you want to exfiltrate data, download a tool, or execute commands on 
your command and control server (C2). Problem is - the first leg of 
connectivity to your C2 is denied. Your DNS and ICMP traffic is being 
monitored. Access to your cloud drives is restricted. You've implemented
 domain fronting for your C2 only to discover it is ranked low by the 
content proxy, which is only allowing access to a handful of business 
related websites on the outside. <br><br>

We have all been there, seeing frustrating proxy denies or triggering security alarms making our presence known.<br>Having
 more choices when it comes to outbound network connectivity helps. In 
this talk we'll present a technique to establish such connectivity with 
the help of HTTP callbacks (webhooks). We will walk you through what 
webhooks are, how they are used by organizations. We will then discuss 
how you can use approved sites as brokers of your communication, perform
 data transfers, establish almost realtime asynchronous command 
execution, and even create a command-and-control communication over 
them, bypassing strict defensive proxies, and even avoiding attribution.
  <br><br>

Finally, we'll release the tool that will use the concept of a broker website to work with the external C2 using webhooks.</p>

did some double checking. <br><br>

So, I started fuzzing and reverse engineering. While the TM06 is a cute

not. In this talk, I will take you on my journey revealing my 
methodology for discovering and exploiting two memory corruption 
vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are severe and while theyâve been 
reported to the vendor, they are very revealing data points about the 
security state of such devices. While the device employs some 
exploitation mitigations, there are many missing. I will be showing how I
 was able to bypass them and what mitigations shouldâve been employed, 
such as NX-Stack/Heap, canaries, etc, to prevent me from gaining 
arbitrary shellcode execution.<br><br>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Genetic Diseases to Guide Digital Hacks of the 
Human Genome: How the Cancer Moonshot Program will Enable Almost Anyone 
to Crash the Operating System that Runs You or to End Civilization... </h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 12:00 in Track 4</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes</p>
<h4 class="speaker">John Sotos<span class="speakerTitle"> Chief Medical Officer, Intel Corporation</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">The human genome is, fundamentally, a complex 
open-source digital operating system (and set of application programs) 
built on the digital molecules DNA and RNA. <br><br>

The genome has thousands of publicly documented, unpatchable security 
vulnerabilities, previously called "genetic diseases." Because emerging 
DNA/RNA technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 and especially those arising
 from the Cancer Moonshot program, will create straightforward methods 
to digitally reprogram the genome in free-living humans, malicious 
exploitation of genomic vulnerabilities will soon be possible on a wide 
scale. <br><br>

This presentation shows the breathtaking potential for such hacks, most 
notably the exquisite targeting precision that the genome supports â in 
effect, population, and time â spanning annoyance to organized crime to 
civilization-ending pandemics far worse than Ebola. <br><br>

Because humans are poor at responding to less-than-immediate threats, 
and because there is no marketplace demand for defensive technologies on
 the DNA/RNA platform, the hacker community has an important role to 
play in devising thought-experiments to convince policy makers to 
initiate defensive works, before offensive hacks can be deployed in the 
wild. Hackers can literally save the world... from ourselves.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">spaceB0x<span class="speakerTitle"> Sr. Security Engineer at LeanKit Inc.</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Continuous Integration (CI) systems and similar 
architecture has taken new direction, especially in the last few years. 
Automating code builds, tests, and deployments is helping hordes of 
developers release code, and is saving companies a great amount of time 
and resources. But at what cost? The sudden and strong demand for these 
systems have created some widely adopted practices that have large 
security implications, especially if these systems are hosted 
internally. I have developed a tool that will help automate some 
offensive testing against certain popular CI build systems. There has 
been a large adoption of initiating these builds through web hooks of 
various kinds, especially changes to public facing code repositories. I 
will start with a brief overview of some of the more popular CI tools 
and how they are being used in many organizations. This is good 
information for understanding, at a high level, the purpose of these 
systems as well as some security benefits that they can provide. From 
there we will dive into specific examples of how these different CI 
implementations have created vulnerabilities (in one case to a CI vendor
 themselves). Last we will explore the tool, its purpose, and a 
demonstration of its use. This tool takes advantage of the 
configurations of various components of the build chain to look for 
vulnerabilities. It then has the capability to exploit, persist access, 
command and control vulnerable build containers. Most of the 
demonstration will revolve around specific CI products and repositories,
 however the concepts are applicable across most build systems. The goal
 here is to encourage further exploration of these exploitation 
concepts. The tool is built "modularly" to facilitate this. If you are 
new to CI and automated build systems, or if you have been doing it for 
years, this talk and tool will help you to better secure your 
architecture</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Jason Staggs<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Researcher at the University of Tulsa</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Wind farms are becoming a leading source for 
renewable energy. The increased reliance on wind energy makes wind farm 
control systems attractive targets for attackers. This talk explains how
 wind farm control networks work and how they can be attacked in order 
to negatively influence wind farm operations (e.g., wind turbine 
hijacking). Specifically, implementations of the IEC 61400-25 family of 
communications protocols are investigated (i.e., OPC XML-DA). This 
research is based on an empirical study of a variety of U.S. based wind 
farms conducted over a two year period. We explain how these security 
assessments reveal that wind farm vendor design and implementation flaws
 have left wind turbine programmable automation controllers and OPC 
servers vulnerable to attack. Additionally, proof-of-concept attack 
tools are developed in order to exploit wind farm control network design
 and implementation vulnerabilities.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Suggy (AKA Chris Sumner)<span class="speakerTitle"> Researcher, The Online Privacy Foundation</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Psychographic targeting and the so called 
"Weaponized AI Propaganda Machine" have been blamed for swaying public 
opinion in recent political campaigns. But how effective are they? Why 
are people so divided on certain topics? And what influences their 
views? This talk presents the results of five studies exploring each of 
these questions. The studies examined authoritarianism, threat 
perception, personality-targeted advertising and biases in relation to 
support for communication surveillance as a counter-terrorism strategy. 
We found that people with an authoritarian disposition were more likely 
to be supportive of surveillance, but that those who are less 
authoritarian became increasingly supportive of such surveillance the 
greater they perceived the threat of terrorism. Using psychographic 
targeting we reached Facebook audiences with significantly different 
views on surveillance and demonstrated how tailoring pro and 
anti-surveillance ads based on authoritarianism affected return on 
marketing investment. Finally, we show how debunking propaganda faces 
big challenges as biases severely limit a person's ability to interpret 
evidence which runs contrary to their beliefs. The results illustrate 
the effectiveness of psychographic targeting and the ease with which 
individuals' inherent differences and biases can be exploited.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Matt Suiche<span class="speakerTitle"> Founder, Comae Technologies</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the 
blockchain community, mainly due to fact that it is design in a way that
 enables developers to write decentralized applications (Dapps) and 
smart-contract using blockchain technology.<br><br>

Ethereum blockchain is a consensus-based globally executed virtual 
machine, also referred as  Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by implemented
 its own micro-kernel supporting a handful number of instructions, its 
own stack, memory and storage. This enables the radical new concept of 
distributed applications.<br><br>

Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format 
(EVM bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in some 
high-level language such as Solidity and then compiled into byte code to
 be uploaded on the blockchain. Solidity is a contract-oriented, 
high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript.<br>This
 new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and 
opportunities. Blockchain is often referred as secure by design, but now
 that blockchains can embed applications this raise multiple questions 
regarding architecture, design, attack vectors and patch deployments.<br><br>

As we, reverse engineers, know having access to source code is often a 
luxury. Hence, the need for an open-source tool like Porosity: 
decompiler for EVM bytecode into readable Solidity-syntax contracts - to
 enable static and dynamic analysis of compiled contracts.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Game of Chromes: Owning the Web with Zombie Chrome Extensions</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 13:00 in 101 Track</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Tomer Cohen<span class="speakerTitle"> R&amp;D Security Team Leader, Wix.com</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">On April 16 2016, an army of bots stormed upon Wix 
servers, creating new accounts and publishing shady websites in mass. 
The attack was carried by a malicious Chrome extension, installed on 
tens of thousands of devices, sending HTTP requests simultaneously. This
 "Extension Bot" has used Wix websites platform and Facebook messaging 
service, to distribute itself among users. Two months later, same 
attackers strike again. This time they used infectious notifications, 
popping up on Facebook and leading to a malicious Windows-runnable JSE 
file. Upon clicking, the file ran and installed a Chrome extension on 
the victim's browser. Then the extension used Facebook messaging once 
again to pass itself on to more victims.<br><br>

Analyzing these attacks, we were amazed by the highly elusive nature of 
these bots, especially when it comes to bypassing web-based 
bot-detection systems. This shouldn't be surprising, since legit browser
 extensions are supposed to send Facebook messages, create Wix websites,
 or in fact perform any action on behalf of the user.<br><br>

On the other hand, smuggling a malicious extension into Google Web Store
 and distributing it among victims efficiently, like these attackers 
did, is let's say - not a stroll in the park. But don't worry, there are
 other options.<br><br>

Recently, several popular Chrome extensions were found to be vulnerable 
to XSS. Yep, the same old XSS every rookie finds in so many web 
applications. So browser extensions suffer from it too, and sadly, in 
their case it can be much deadlier than in regular websites. One 
noticeable example is the Adobe Acrobat Chrome extension, which was 
silently installed on January 10 by Adobe, on an insane number of 30 
million devices. A DOM-based XSS vulnerability in the extension (found 
by Google Project Zero) allowed an attacker to craft a content that 
would run Javascript as the extension.<br><br>

In this talk I will show how such a flaw leads to full and permanent 
control over the victim's browser, turning the extension into zombie. 
Additionally, Shedding more light on the 2016 attacks on Wix and 
Facebook described in the beginning, I will demonstrate how an attacker 
can use similar techniques to distribute her malicious payload 
efficiently on to new victims, through popular social platforms - 
creating the web's most powerful botnet ever.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">When Privacy Goes Poof! Why It's Gone and Never Coming Back</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Saturday at 12:00 in Track 2</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | 0025</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Richard Thieme a.k.a. neuralcowboy<span class="speakerTitle"> </span></h4>
<p class="abstract">"Get over it!" as Scott McNeeley said - unhelpfully.
 Only if we understand why it is gone and not coming back do we have a 
shot at rethinking what privacy means in a new context. Thieme goes deep
 and wide as he rethinks the place of privacy in the new social/cultural
 context and challenges contemporary discussions to stop using 20th 
century frames. Pictures don't fit those frames, including pictures of 
"ourselves." <br><br>

We have always known we were cells in a body, but we emphasized 
"cell-ness". Now we have to emphasize "body-ness" and see ourselves 
differently. What we see depends on the level of abstraction at which we
 look. The boundaries we imagine around identities, psyches, private 
internal spaces," are violated in both directions, going in and going 
out, by data that, when aggregated, constitutes "us". We are known by 
others more deeply in recombination from metadata than we know 
ourselves. We are not who we think we are.<br><br>

To understand privacy - even what we mean by "individuals" who want it -
 requires a contrary opinion. Privacy is honored in lip service, but not
 in the marketplace, where it is violated every day. To confront the 
challenges of technological change, we have to know what is happening to
 "us" so we can re-imagine what we mean by privacy, security, and 
identity. We can't say what we can't think. We need new language to 
grasp our own new "human nature" that has been reconstituted from 
elements like orange juice.  <br><br>

The weakest link in discussions of privacy is the definition of privacy,
 and the definition of privacy is not what we think. Buddhists call 
enlightenment a "nightmare in daylight", yet it is enlightenment still, 
and that kind of clarity is the goal of this presentation.</p>

<p class="abstract">In response to public security breaches many 
retailers have begun efforts to minimize or completely prevent the 
transmission of unencrypted credit card data through their store 
networks and point of sale systems. While this is definitely a great 
improvement over the previous state of affairs; it places the security 
of transactions squarely in the hands of credit card terminals purchased
 from third party vendors. These terminals have a security posture that 
is often not well understood by the retail chains purchasing them. To 
better understand if the trust placed in these devices is warranted, the
 attack surface and hardening of a commonly deployed credit card 
terminal series is reviewed and a discussion of reverse engineered 
security APIs is presented. Despite the reduced attack surface of the 
terminals and hardened configuration, attacks that allow recovery of 
magstripe track data and PIN codes are demonstrated to be possible.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">A New Era of SSRF - Exploiting URL Parser in Trending Programming Languages!</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Friday at 12:00 in Track 3</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Orange Tsai<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Consultant from DEVCORE</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">We propose a new exploit technique that brings a 
whole-new attack surface to bypass SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) 
protections. This is a very general attack approach, in which we used in
 combination with our own fuzzing tool to discover many 0days in 
built-in libraries of very widely-used programming languages, including 
Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Wget and cURL. The root cause
 of the problem lies in the inconsistency of URL parsers and URL 
requesters.<br><br>

Being a very fundamental problem that exists in built-in libraries, 
sophisticated web applications such as WordPress (27% of the Web), 
vBulletin, MyBB and GitHub can also suffer, and 0days have been 
discovered in them via this technique. This general technique can also 
adapt to various code contexts and lead to protocol smuggling and SSRF 
bypassing. Several scenarios will be demonstrated to illustrate how URL 
parsers can be exploited to bypass SSRF protection and achieve RCE 
(Remote Code Execution), which is the case in our GitHub Enterprise 
demo.<br><br>

Understanding the basics of this technique, the audience won't be 
surprised to know that more than 20 vulnerabilities have been found in 
famous programming languages and web applications aforementioned via 
this technique.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words, Literally: Deep Neural Networks for Social Stego</h3>

<h4 class="speaker">Michael T. Raggo<span class="speakerTitle"> Chief Security Officer, 802 Secure</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Images, videos and other digital media provide a 
convenient and expressive way to communicate through social networks. 
But such broadcastable and information-rich content provides ample 
illicit opportunity as well. Web-prevalent image files like JPEGs can be
 disguised with foreign data since they're perceivably robust to minor 
pixel and metadata alterations. Slipping a covert message into one of 
the billions of daily posted images may be possible, but to what extent 
can steganography be systematically automated and scaled?<br><br>

To explore this, we first report the distorting side effects rendered 
upon images uploaded to popular social network servers, e.g. 
compression, resizing, format conversion, and metadata stripping. Then, 
we build a convolutional neural network that learns to reverse engineer 
these transformations by optimizing hidden data throughput capacity. 
From pre-uploaded and downloaded image files, the network learns to 
locate candidate metadata and pixels that are least modifiable during 
transit, allowing stored hidden payloads to be reliably recalled from 
newly presented images. Deep learning typically requires tons of 
training data to avoid over fitting. But data acquisition is trivial 
using social networks' free image hosting services, which feature bulk 
uploads and downloads of thousands of images at a time per album. <br><br>

We show that hidden data can be predictably transmitted through social 
network images with high fidelity. Our results demonstrate that AI can 
hide data in plain sight, at large-scale, beyond human visual 
discernment, and despite third-party manipulation. Steganalysis and 
other defensive forensic countermeasures are notoriously difficult, and 
our exfiltration techniques highlight the growing threat posed by 
automated, AI-powered red teaming.</p>

<h4 class="speaker">Ilja van Sprundel<span class="speakerTitle"> Director of penetration testing, IOActive <br></span></h4>
<p class="abstract">In this presentation I start off asking the question
 "How come there are only a handful of BSD security kernel bugs

some data from several sources. It should come as no surprise that those
 sources are fairly limited and somewhat outdated. <br><br>

The presentation then moves on to try and collect some data ourselves. 
This is done by actively investigating and auditing. Code review, 
fuzzing, runtime testing on all 3 major BSD distributions 
[NetBSD/OpenBSD/FreeBSD]. This is done by first investigating what would
 be good places where the bugs might be. Once determined, a detailed 
review is performed of these places. Samples and demos will be shown. <br><br>

I end the presentation with some results and conclusions. I will list 
what the outcome was in terms of bugs found, and who -based on the data I
 now have- among the 3 main BSD distributions can be seen as the clear 
winner and loser. I will go into detail about the code quality observed 
and give some pointers on how to improve some code. Lastly I will try

<p class="abstract">Today there is practically a year-round CTF circuit,
 on which teams hone their skills, win prizes and attain stature.  For 
many, the ultimate goal is to dominate in the utmost competition, DEF 
CON's CTF, and walk away with a coveted black badge.  Capture-the-Flag 
(CTF) is one of DEF CON's oldest contests, dating back to DEF CON 4.  
Over the past decades, the perennial contest has matured into an annual 
event requiring months of preparation and nearly continuous dedication 
both of players and organizers.  Organizers strive to make the events 
unique while taking extreme measures to prevent games from being gamed. 
 Participants often have to cope with novel challenges while 
simultaneously demonstrating continued excellence in domains like 
reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, digital 
forensics, cryptography, and network security.  In this session, we will
 present the evolution of DEF CON CTF, highlighting key points of 
advancement in the CTF culture - most of which broke new ground and are 
now present in other contests run around the world.  Capitalizing on the
 multi-year tenure of recent DEF CON CTF organizers, we are able to 
concisely represent over 20 years of organizers on a single panel.  
Where else can you ask cross-generational questions about challenges of 
running CTF?  Where else can you inquire about evolutionary design, and 
get answers from those that actually did it?  Where else can you ask 
about hidden challenges, secrets, and CTF lore...from whom it 
originated?<br><br>

The panelists represent over 20 years of DEF CON CTF organizers.  
Staples in the CTF community are present comprising of decades of 
experience in participating and organizing CTFs.  On stage we have past 
organizers representing Legit BS, DDTEK, Kenshoto, Ghetto Hackers, and 
before â many of which also participated as part of top recurring teams 
such as Sk3wl of r00t, Ghetto Hackers, Samurai, and Team Awesome.  Many 
also played some role (infrastructure, challenge author, announcer) in 
the Cyber Grand Challenge culminating last summer at DEF CON.  They have
 received and distributed dozens of black badges.  Panelists and the 
roles they represent for this panel: Hawaii John, Legit Business 
Syndicate; Chris Eagle, DDTEK; Invisigoth, Kenshoto; Caezar, Ghetto 
Hackers; Myles, Goon.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong> Vulc@n</strong><br> Vulc@n have been 
involved in the community since DEF CON 11, which in some ways seems 
recent but upon reflection is clearly more than a decade ago.  In his 
early years he sprinted from talk to talk, dodging curious things like 
mid-school aged folks with baby chickens, couches in purple-dyed pools, 
and real dunk tanks.  He even sat through talks in the blistering heat 
in outdoor tents at Alexis Park.  Starting with his second year 
attending, he was pulled more and more into the CTF contest with then 
new-found and now lifelong friends at Sk3wl of r00t.  Much of his time 
in the years since has been dedicated to playing in CTF or organizing it
 (as part of DDTEK).  Ever since convincing one of his college 
professors to finance my first DEF CON trip, the hacker scene has been 
kind to him.  He now finds himself in possession of two black badges 
(and leather jacket).  More recently he was part of the Cyber Grand 
Challenge development team and was an on-stage referees for the 
all-computer hacking competition this past summer.  In summary, it seems
 that he just keeps finding novel ways to be very involved with DEF CON 
and CTF.<br><br>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Offensive Malware Analysis: Dissecting OSX/FruitFly via a Custom C&amp;C Server</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Friday at 10:20 in 101 Track</p>
	<p class="abstract">20 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Patrick Wardle<span class="speakerTitle"> Chief Security Researcher, Synack / Creator of Objective-See</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Creating a custom command and control (C&amp;C) 
server for someone else's malware has a myriad of benefits. If you can 
take over it a domain, you then may able to fully hijack other hackers' 
infected hosts. A more prosaic benefit is expediting analysis. While 
hackers and governments may be more interested in the former, malware 
analysts can benefit from the later <br><br>

FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing 
specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is 
thought to have flown under the radar for many years. In this talk, 
we'll focus on the 'B' variant of FruitFly that even now, is only 
detected by a handful of security products.<br><br>

We'll begin by analyzing the malware's dropper, an obfuscated perl 
script. As this language is rather archaic and uncommon in malware 
droppers, we'll discuss some debugging techniques and fully deconstruct 
the script. <br><br>

While this dropper component also communicates with the C&amp;C server 
and supports some basic commands, it drops a binary payload in order to 
perform more complex actions. However, instead of fully reversing this 
piece of the malware, the talk will focus on an initial triage and show 
how this was sufficient for the creation of a custom C&amp;C server. 
With such a server, we can easily coerce the malware to reveal it's full
 capabilities. For example, the malware invokes a handful of low-level 
mouse &amp; graphics APIs, passing in a variety of dynamic parameters. 
Instead of spending hours reversing and debugging this complex code, via
 the C&amp;C server, we can simply send it various commands and observe 
the effects. <br><br>

Of course this approach hinges on the ability to closely observe the 
malware's actions. As such, we'll discuss macOS-specific tools that can 
monitor various events, and where necessary detail the creation of 
custom ones (e.g. a 'mouse sniffer' that locally observes and decodes 
commands sent from the malware to the OS, in order to control the 
mouse).<br><br>

While some of this talk is FruitFly and/or macOS specific, conceptually 
it should broadly apply to analyzing other malware, even on other 
operating systems :)</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">Death By 1000 Installers; on macOS, it's all broken!</h3>

	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Exploit</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Patrick Wardle<span class="speakerTitle"> Chief Security Researcher, Synack</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Ever get an uneasy feeling when an installer asks 
for your password? Well, your gut was right! The majority of macOS 
installers &amp; updaters are vulnerable to a wide range of priv-esc 
attacks.<br><br>

It began with the discovery that Apple's OS updater could be abused to 
bypass SIP (CVE-2017-6974). Next, turns out Apple's core installer app 
may be subverted to load unsigned dylibs which may elevate privileges to
 root.<br><br>

And what about 3rd-party installers? I looked at what's installed on my Mac, and ahhh, so many bugs! <br><br>

Firewall, Little Snitch: EoP via race condition of insecure plist<br>Anti-Virus, Sophos: EoP via hijack of binary component <br>Browser, Google Chrome: EoP via script hijack<br>Virtualization, VMWare Fusion: EoP via race condition of insecure script<br>IoT, DropCam: EoP via hijack of binary component<br>and more!<br><br>

...and 3rd-party auto-update frameworks like Sparkle -yup vulnerable too!<br><br>

Though root is great, we can't bypass SIP nor load unsigned kexts. 
However with root, I discovered one could now trigger a ring-0 
heap-overflow that provides complete system control.<br><br>

Though the talk will discuss a variety of discovery mechanisms, 0days, 
and macOS exploitation techniques, it won't be all doom &amp; gloom. 
We'll end by discussing ways to perform authorized installs/upgrades 
that don't undermine system security."</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">If You Give a Mouse a Microchip... It will execute a payload and cheat at your high-stakes video game tournament</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Saturday at 11:00 in Track 3</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">skud (Mark Williams)<span class="speakerTitle"> Embedded Software Engineer </span></h4>
<h4 class="speaker">Sky (Rob Stanley)<span class="speakerTitle"> Security Software Engineer, Lead</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">The International, a recent esports tournament, had a
 20 million dollar prize pool with over five million people tuned in to 
the final match. The high stakes environment at tournaments creates an 
incentive for players to cheat for a competitive advantage. Cheaters are
 always finding new ways to modify software, from attempting to sneak 
executables in on flash drives, to using cheats stored in Steam's online
 workshop which bypasses IP restrictions.<br><br>

This presentation describes how one can circumvent existing security 
controls to sneak a payload (game cheat) onto a target computer. Esports
 tournaments typically allow players to provide their own mouse and 
keyboard, as these players prefer to use specific devices or may be 
obligated to use a sponsor branded device. These "simple" USB input 
devices can still be used to execute complex commands on a computer via 
the USB Human Interface Device (HID) protocol.<br><br>

Our attack vector is a mouse with an ARM Cortex M series processor. The 
microcontroller stores custom user profiles in flash memory, allowing 
the mouse to retain user settings between multiple computers. We modify 
the device's firmware to execute a payload delivery program, stored in 
free space in flash memory, before returning the mouse to its original 
functionality. Retaining original functionality allows the mouse to be 
used discreetly, as it is an "expected" device at these tournaments. 
This concept applies to any USB device that uses this processor, and 
does not require obvious physical modifications. <br><br>

This delivery method has tradeoffs. Our exploit is observable, as 
windows are created and in focus during payload delivery. The advantage 
to this approach is that it bypasses other security measures that are 
commonly in place, such as filtered internet traffic and disabled USB 
mass storage.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">See no evil, hear no evil: Hacking invisibly and silently with light and sound</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Thursday at 14:00 in 101 Track 2</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Tool</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Matt Wixey<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Associate, PwC</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Traditional techniques for C2 channels, 
exfiltration, surveillance, and exploitation are often frustrated by the
 growing sophistication and prevalence of security protections, 
monitoring solutions, and controls. Whilst all is definitely not lost, 
from an attacker's perspective - we constantly see examples of attackers
 creatively bypassing such protections - it is always beneficial to have
 more weapons in one's arsenal, particularly when coming up against 
heavily-defended networks and highly-secured environments.<br><br>

This talk demonstrates a number of techniques and attacks which leverage
 light and/or sound, using off-the-shelf hardware. It covers everything 
from C2 channels and exfiltration using light and near-ultrasonic sound,
 to disabling and disrupting motion detectors; from laser microphones, 
to repelling drones; from trolling friends, to jamming speech and 
demotivating malware analysts.<br><br>

This talk not only provides attendees with a new suite of techniques and
 methodologies to consider when coming up against a well-defended 
target, but also demonstrates, in a hopefully fun and practical way, how
 these techniques work, their advantages, disadvantages, and possible 
future developments. It also gives details of real case studies where 
some of these techniques have been used, and provides defenders with 
realistic methods for the mitigation of these attacks.<br><br>

Finally, the talk covers some ideas for future research in this area.</p>

<p class="abstract">Do you have a collection of vulnerable programs that
 you have not yet been able to exploit? There may yet still be hope. 
This talk will show you how to look deeper (lower level). If you've ever
 heard experts say how x86 assembly language is just a one-to-one 
relationship to its machine-code, then we need to have a talk. This is 
that talk; gruesome detail on how an assembly instruction can have 
multiple valid representations in machine-code and vice versa. You can 
also just take my word for it, ignore the details like a bro, and use 
the tool that will be released for this talk: the Interactive Redundant 
Assembler (irasm). You can just copy the alternate machine code from the
 tool and use it in other tools like mona, use it to give yourself more 
options for self-modifying code, fork Hydan (stego) and give it more 
variety, or to create peace on earth.</p>

<h3 class="talkTitle">There's no place like 127.0.0.1 - Achieving reliable DNS rebinding in modern browsers</h3>
	<p class="abstract">Thursday at 10:00 in 101 Track</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Luke Young<span class="speakerTitle"> Senior Information Security Engineer, LinkedIn</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Most people lock their doors at night, however if 
you walk into someone's home you likely won't find every piece of 
furniture bolted to the floor as well. We trust that if someone is 
inside our home they are supposed to be there. Unfortunately many 
developers treat local networks just the same, assuming all internal 
HTTP traffic is trusted, however this is not always the case. They 
incorrectly assume that their services will be protected by the 
same-origin policy in browsers, rather than implementing proper 
authentication mechanisms. By abusing this implicit trust we can gain 
access to confidential data and internal services which are not intended
 to be publicly accessible. <br><br>

I will demonstrate that this is a poor security control and can be 
trivially bypassed via an older technique, DNS rebinding. The talk will 
cover how DNS rebinding works, the mitigations imposed by modern 
browsers and networks, and how each mitigation can be bypassed. I will 
discuss the notorious unreliability of DNS rebinding attacks that causes
 many developers to ignore the issue and how to overcome this 
unreliability. <br><br>

Finally, I will examine a variety of popular services and tools to 
understand how they are affected by DNS rebinding. I will be releasing a
 tool that allows researchers to automate DNS rebinding attacks, the 
associated mitigation bypasses and generate drop-dead simple 
proof-of-concept exploits. I will demonstrate this tool by developing 
exploits for each vulnerable service, ending the talk by exploiting a 
vulnerable service to obtain remote-code execution, live. </p>

<h3 class="talkTitle"> 25 Years of Program Analysis </h3>
	<p class="abstract">Sunday at 15:00 in 101 Track</p>
	<p class="abstract">45 minutes | Hacker History, Demo</p>
<h4 class="speaker">Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)<span class="speakerTitle"> Assitant Professor, Arizona State University</span></h4>
<p class="abstract">Last year, DARPA hosted the Cyber Grand Challenge, 
the culmination of humanity's research into autonomous detection, 
exploitation, and mitigation of software vulnerabilities. Imagine the 
CGC from the outside: huge racks of servers battling it out on stage, 
throwing exploit after exploit at each other while humans watch 
helplessly from the sidelines. But that vantage point misses the program
 analysis methods used, the subtle trade-offs made, and the actual 
capabilities of these systems. It also misses why, outside of the 
controlled CGC environment, most automated techniques don't quite scale 
to the analysis of real-world software!<br><br>
 
This talk will provide a better perspective. On the 25th anniversary of 
DEFCON, we will go through these last 25 years of program analysis. 
We'll learn about the different disciplines of program analysis (and 
learn strange terms such as static, dynamic, symbolic, and abstract), 
understand the strength and drawbacks of each, and see if, and to what 
extent, they are used in the course of actual vulnerability analysis.<br><br>
 
Did you know that every finalist system in the Cyber Grand Challenge 
used a combination of dynamic analysis and symbolic execution to find 
vulnerabilities, but used static analysis to patch them? Why is that? 
Did you know that, to make the contest feasible for modern program 
analysis techniques, the CGC enforced a drastically-simplified OS model?
 What does this mean for you, if you want to use program analysis while 
finding vulns and collecting bug bounties? Come to this talk, become an 
expert, and go on to contribute to the future of program analysis!</p>

<p class="abstract">Kernel bug is always very difficult to reproduce and
 may lead to the entire system panic and restart. In practice, kernel 
debugging is the only way to analyze panic scenes. However, implementing
 such a technique in real world is not an easy task since kernel code 
cannot be executed in the debugger, thus is hard to be tracked. Luckily,
 macOS has provided a very powerful kernel debugging mechanism, KDK 
(Kernel Development Kit), to assist people to analyze and develop kernel
 exploits. While for iOS, although there is no official kernel debugger,
 it is also possible for us to achieve kernel debugging by leveraging 
some tricks.<br><br>

In this talk, we will share some kernel debugging techniques and their 
corresponding tricks on the latest iOS/macOS. In addition, we will also 
introduce the new kernel heap mitigation mechanisms on iOS 10/macOS 
10.12 and two heap feng shui techniques to bypass them. Finally, we will
 demonstrate how to debug a concrete kernel heap overflow bug and then 
leverage our new heap feng shui techniques to gain arbitrary kernel 
memory read/write on the iOS 10.2/macOS 10.12.</p>

<p class="abstract">One vulnerability in CSFB (Circuit Switched 
Fallback) in 4G LTE network will be presented. In the CSFB procedure, we
 found the authentication step is missing. This results in that an 
attacker can hijack the victim's communication. We named this attack as 
'Ghost Telephonist'. Several exploitations can be made based on this 
vulnerability. When the call or SMS is not encrypted, or weakly 
encrypted, the attacker can impersonate the victim to receive the 
"Mobile Terminated" calls and messages or to initiate the "Mobile 
Originated" calls and messages. Furthermore, Telephonist Attack can 
obtain the victim's phone number and then use the phone number to make 
advanced attack, e.g. breaking Internet online accounts. These attacks 
can randomly choose victims, or target a given victim. We verified these
 attack with our own phones in operators' network in a small 
controllable scale. The experiments proved the vulnerability really 
exists. The attack doesn't need fake base station so the attack cost is 
low. The victim doesn't sense being attacked since no fake base station 
and no cell re-selection. Now we are collaborating with operators and 
terminal manufactures to fix this vulnerability.</p>
